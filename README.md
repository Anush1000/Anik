# E-commerce Project

This e-commerce project was completed this month by learning and implementing the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.


## Project Overview

This project is an e-commerce application designed to provide a seamless shopping experience. It includes features like user authentication, product listings, a shopping cart, and a user wishlist. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB for data storage. The frontend is developed with React.
